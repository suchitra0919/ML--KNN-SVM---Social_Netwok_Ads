# ML--KNN-SVM---Social_Netwok_Ads

Understanding the Problem and Approach

Problem:
We have information about people who saw an ad on a social network. We know their gender, age, salary, and whether or not they bought the product. We want to predict if someone will buy the product based on this information.

Data:
Gender: Male or female
Age: Age of the person
Estimated Salary: How much the person earns
Purchased: Whether the person bought the product (Yes or No)

Goal:
Build a model that can predict if a new person will buy the product based on their gender, age, and salary.

Methods:
We will use three different methods to build the model:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): This method looks at the people most similar to the new person and predicts based on what they did.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): This method finds the best line (or plane) to separate people who bought the product from those who didn't.
Kernel SVM: This is a more complex version of SVM that can handle more complicated data patterns.

Hyperparameter Tuning:
SVM has some settings (called hyperparameters) that can affect how well it works. We will try different settings to find the best ones for our data. This is like trying different recipes to find the best cake.

In Summary:
We're trying to guess if someone will buy a product based on who they are. We'll use three different methods to do this and find the best settings for one of the methods.
